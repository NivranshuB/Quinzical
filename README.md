Adding new questions and categories to the question bank:


Adding a new category:

	1) Go to the 'categories' folder that is on the same level as this README.md file
	
	2) Create a new file inside this folder and name it whatever the new category's name will be
	
	3) In the new file add at least 5 questions about this category (look below for 
	instructions on adding new questions)
	
Adding a new question: 

	1) Go to the category file in the categories folder you want to add a new question to, 
	or create a new category for this question first using the instructions above
	
	2) In this category file, add a new line for the question you would like to add
	
	3) The format of a question line must be the following:
	
	'question'|'clue'|'answer'
	
	Ex) This New Zealander led the 1975 land march from Te Hapua to Parliament|who is|Dame Whina Cooper
	
	4) Remember after adding or removing questions from the categories folder, you must make
	sure that there are at least 5 questions in each category file
