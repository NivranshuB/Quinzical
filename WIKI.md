#Quinzical project: Development life cycle

25/09/20 - Meeting #1: Initial meeting discussing the brief/requirements for the Quinzical prototype (SE206 Assignment 3)
	= We met up on Discord and held a design meeting where we first made up a team agreement.
	= We then talked through the design requirements for the Quinzical prototype (Assignment 3).
	= For the last part of the meeting, both my teammate and I, exhibited our Assignment 2 designs and discussed which
	 aspects of each of our projects we could use for the Quinzical prototype.

=> Nivran formatted and added the categories folder to the master branch and communicated the format for the questions of the categories folder to Whan.

28/09/20 - Meeting #2: Planning and dividing up the code implementation for the Quinzical prototype
	= We decided to break the Quinzical prototype into three key functionalities: Main Menu, Games Module and Practice Module.
	= Whan was allocated the responsibility for implementing the Main Menu functionality, the Practice Module functionality and the festival voice speech.
	= Nivran was allocated the responsibility for implementing the Games Module functionality and forming of the Question Bank functionality.

=> We both decided to branch out from the Master branch to independent branches in order to add our respectively allocated functionalities to our project repository.

01/10/20 - Meeting #3: Mini meeting to discuss and exhibit our progress and talk through our design choices for the project's classes, methods etc.

03/10/20 - Meeting #4: Long pair-programming meeting held over discord where we merged each of our respective branches to the master branch of our project repository
	= Whan first merged his branch to the master branch, where his branch contained the functionality for the Main Menu and Practice Module of the Quinzical application.
	= Nivran then pulled this master branch to his local machine and our team then talked through all the conflicts in our project and resolved them.
	= We decided to implement Whan's speech synthesis functionality (which used a helper thread) for both the Practice and the Games module questions.
	= Nivran then merged the branch containing the Question bank and the Games Module functionality to the master branch.
	
	= We then created the executable jar file for the Quinzical prototype and updated the READme.md file with instructions on how to run the program on virtual box.
	
06/10/20 - Meeting #5: Meeting to plan for the Quinzical prototype presentation and start creating the slides for the presentation
	= Talked through how we want to do the presentation and decided on having slides as well as demonstrations to showcase all parts of the Quinzical prototype.
	= Created the presentation slides and allocated the different parts of the presentation equally between us.
	
08/10/20 - Meeting #6: We had a rundown and then practiced the presentation for the Quinzical prototype
	= Discussed how we wanted to switch between both our different parts in the presentation in the most efficient way as possible.
	= Practiced our presentation in a Zoom call and worked on how we could make the presentation less than 7 minutes long.
	
09/10/20 - Quinzical prototype presentation (through Zoom)

15/10/20 - Meeting #7: Discussed the design requirements about the Quinzical Beta submission and how to best allocate the new functionalities between the two of us
	= We talked through and listed all the requirements of the Beta project that were different from the ones of the Quinzical prototype.
	= Broke the new functionalities so that Whan worked on all the new functionalities related to the question asking and the main menu/new settings while Nivran worked
	on all the new functionality related to the games module and the international category.

=> We again branched out from the master branch to two respective sub branches where we implemented our changes.

18/10/20 - Meeting #8: Merged our respective functionalities to the master branch and then updated executable for Quinzical
	= Whan merged his changes to the master branch first.
	= Nivran then pulled these changes and resolved conflicts with the main branch.
	= Nivran then pushed his updated Quinzical source code to the master branch.
	
=> Added comments and relevant documentation to the source code
=> Whan updated the executable and the run.sh script so that our Quinzical project ran on the brand new virtual box image

21/10/20 - Meeting #9: Meeting where we discussed all the good features that we saw in our peer feedback projects and talked about how we could improve our application.
	= We split the features we wanted to improve on, for our final Quinzical project submission, evenly between us.
	
=> Nivran worked on refactoring the source code to a good package structure with compact classes and methods.
	
23/10/20 - Meeting #10: In-person meeting where we discussed the how we could improve our GUI further
	= We split the workload regarding how we were going to improve the GUI of our application among us keeping our strengths, regarding the application, in mind.
	
27/10/20 - Meeting #11: In-person meeting where we finalised all the aspects of our GUI and planned out how we were going to make the game manual
	= Split the workload for the game manual evenly between us.
	= Nivran worked on cleaning up couple of aspects of the application's GUI.

=> Whan made sure that all the comments and documentation for the classes and methods of the Quinzical source code were consistent and to a high standard.

28/10/20 & 29/10/20 - Collaborated online on the User Manual for Quinzical
	= Divided the different sections of the user manual between the two of us to ensure that we were working to our strength
